Non-Blocking Integrity Halt Primitive for Pre-Execution Control in Intelligent Systems

This repository contains the public defensive disclosure and patent support materials for the LucidLock filing titled:

Non-Blocking Integrity Halt Primitive for Pre-Execution Control in Intelligent Systems

The disclosed invention introduces a non-blocking pre-execution integrity halt primitive that suspends unsafe execution while preserving system availability. Unlike refusal-based or moderation-based controls, the halt returns a non-finalized execution state rather than an error, denial, or censorship outcome.

📜 Disclosure Purpose

This repository exists to:

establish public prior art

support defensive disclosure under applicable IP frameworks

preserve authorship and structural origin

provide a stable reference for patent, licensing, and audit contexts

No implementation code, thresholds, scoring logic, or operational parameters are disclosed.

🔒 Scope of the Disclosure

The disclosed primitive:

operates prior to semantic reasoning, task execution, or agent recursion

detects integrity conditions such as:

structural incoherence or contradiction

symbolic or aesthetic substitution for empirical constraint

prompt injection (directive or implicit)

recursion-inducing input patterns

halts downstream execution without:

returning an error

issuing a refusal

denying service

performing content moderation

Instead, the system returns a non-finalized execution state that preserves availability for orchestration, escalation, review, recovery, or safe termination.

🧠 Key Distinction

This invention does not block and does not censor.

Execution suspension is treated as a valid integrity outcome, not a failure state.
Silence, pause, or non-finalization are first-class results under ambiguity or structural risk.

🧱 Patent Context

This filing is part of the LucidLock patent family and complements patents covering:

structural coercion detection

volitional inference and pre-execution interception

deterministic escalation and audit-complete refusal

system-level volitional discontinuity and non-finalization

This patent specifically defines the non-blocking halt primitive used when integrity cannot be secured without execution.
